The 3.0 Release consolidates all changes to Canoo WebTest since release 2.6 (see Change log)

This is the recommended version of WebTest for beginners. Existing users are also encouraged to upgrade. 
It offers many improvements over release 2.6 (bug fixes, speed improvements, better javascript support, ...)

Contrary to earlier releases, release 3.0 requires Java 5.

Warning: possible changes in XPath usage
Starting with build 1700, the HtmlUnit version used by WebTest has been 
upgraded to the latest 2.x release, which doesn't use Jaxen anymore for 
XPath evaluation with a custom document navigator but standard DOM tools. 
The consequence is that XPath expressions now have to be "fully correct" 
and can't use shortcuts that were previously available. For example an 
expression like "//tr[td='2.1']/td[3]" won't work anymore and should be 
replaced with something like "//tr[td/text() = '2.1']/td[3]". 
Additionally, spaces are no longer trimmed to respect XPath standards 
(the function wt:cleanText can be used to ignore whitespaces).

The release has the tag R_1758 in the repository.


All tickets closed at the time of build R_1758 are:
